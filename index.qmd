Hi, my name is Izack Takazawa, and I am a student athlete at Chaminade University of Honolulu. I am a Data Science and Visualization major while continuing my athletic career as a right-handed pitcher for the Silversword baseball team. I have a sister who currently is a Sophmore at Iolani School and also plays softball. After high school I attended St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN to further my academic and athletic career, but chose to transfer home after just one year.
